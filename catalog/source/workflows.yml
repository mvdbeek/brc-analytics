      Processes raw FASTQ data through adapter and bad quality removal (cutadapt), alignment
      (Bowtie2 end-to-end), and filtering (removes MT reads, discordant pairs, low mapping
      quality <30, PCR duplicates). Generates 5' cut site pileups (Â±100bp), performs
      peak calling, and quantifies reads in 1kb summit-centered regions. Produces two
      normalized coverage tracks (per million mapped reads and per million reads in
      peaks) and fragment length distribution plots for quality assessment.

    workflow_name: Single-Cell Pseudobulk Differential Expression Analysis with edgeR
    workflow_description:
      Performs differential gene expression analysis on single-cell
      data using a pseudobulk approach. Aggregates cell-level counts from an annotated
      AnnData object by cell type or other metadata using Decoupler, then applies edgeR
      for robust statistical testing between conditions. Includes data preprocessing
      steps for compatibility with edgeR and generates interactive volcano plots to
      visualize significantly differentially expressed genes.

    workflow_name: RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis with Visualization
    workflow_description:
      Identifies differentially expressed genes between exactly
      two experimental conditions from count tables. The workflow performs statistical
      testing, applies filters based on adjusted p-value and log2 fold change thresholds,
      and generates publication-quality visualizations including volcano plots, MA plots,
      and heatmaps. Takes two collections of count tables as input and produces filtered
      gene lists and interactive plots for interpreting expression differences. Optimal
      for simple two-condition experimental designs.
